# BeatsChain Next Steps Implementation

We've implemented the next steps for BeatsChain's Sanity CMS integration with no breaking changes:

## 1. Content Migration

### Implemented:
- ✅ Created a script to migrate hardcoded pages to Sanity blocks (`scripts/migration/migrate-all-pages.js`)
- ✅ Converted the Guide page to use tabs, accordions, and feature cards (`scripts/migration/convert-guide-to-blocks.js`)
- ✅ Added support for FAQ, Terms, and Privacy pages

### How to Use:
```bash
# Migrate the Guide page to Sanity blocks
node packages/app/scripts/migration/convert-guide-to-blocks.js

# Migrate all hardcoded pages to Sanity blocks
node packages/app/scripts/migration/migrate-all-pages.js
```

## 2. Component Enhancements

### Implemented:
- ✅ Added animation options to all block types:
  - Fade In
  - Slide Up
  - Slide In
  - Zoom In
  - Bounce
- ✅ Added animation delay and duration controls
- ✅ Added accessibility enhancements (focus styles, screen reader support)
- ✅ Added responsive behavior controls (columns for feature cards)

### How to Use:
Animation options are available in the Sanity Studio for all block types. You can select:
- Animation type
- Delay (in milliseconds)
- Duration (in milliseconds)

## 3. Editor Experience

### Implemented:
- ✅ Created block templates for common patterns:
  - FAQ Section
  - Feature Tabs
  - Feature Cards
  - How It Works Steps
- ✅ Added custom Sanity Studio structure with templates section
- ✅ Added support for drag-and-drop reordering in the Studio

### How to Use:
1. Open the Sanity Studio at `/studio`
2. Navigate to the "Block Templates" section
3. Select a template to use as a starting point
4. Customize the template and save it to your page

## Technical Implementation

### Animation System:
- Added animation classes to global CSS
- Updated components to support animation props
- Added animation options to block schemas

### Block Templates:
- Created a templates system in `sanity/structure/blockTemplates.js`
- Integrated templates into the Sanity Studio structure
- Added support for creating pages from templates

### Content Migration:
- Created scripts to convert hardcoded content to Sanity blocks
- Maintained backward compatibility with fallback content
- Added support for rich content with portable text

## No Breaking Changes

All enhancements maintain backward compatibility:

1. **Fallback Content**: If Sanity content isn't available, the system falls back to hardcoded content
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Animation and styling options are optional
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Components work even without advanced features
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing pages continue to work without modification

## Next Steps

1. **Run Migration Scripts**:
   ```bash
   node packages/app/scripts/migration/migrate-all-pages.js
   ```

2. **Update Animation Options**:
   ```bash
   node packages/app/scripts/migration/add-animation-to-schemas.js
   ```

3. **Deploy Updated Studio**:
   ```bash
   yarn deploy
   ```
