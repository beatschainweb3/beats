# BeatsChain Analysis - July 21, 2024

## Issues Identified

1. **Client-Side Exception on Producer Pages**
   - Error on `/producer/default-1` and `/producer/sample-producer`
   - Related to premature Web3 hook execution

2. **Blog Hero Image Missing**
   - Blog article at `/blog/what-is-a-beatnft` missing hero image
   - Image exists in Sanity but not displayed on frontend

3. **Sanity Schema Error**
   - Unknown field `heroSection{"_type":"blogHero",...}`
   - Schema type not properly defined

4. **Missing Grid Components**
   - Need consistent grid components for beats, producers, and blog posts
   - Only `EnhancedBlogGrid` exists currently

5. **Social Preview & Metadata Issues**
   - Inconsistent metadata across different page types
   - Images not properly handled in OpenGraph metadata

## Separation of Concerns Analysis

### Data Sources
- **Sanity CMS**: Static content (blog, pages, settings)
- **Web3/Blockchain**: Dynamic content (beats, producers, transactions)

### Integration Points
- **Client Components**: Fetch from both sources
- **Context Providers**: Separate providers for different data sources
- **Metadata Generation**: Attempts to handle both sources

### Current Implementation Issues
- Duplicate Sanity client implementations
- Inconsistent error handling between sources
- Race conditions in data fetching
- Premature Web3 hook execution
- Missing fallback strategies

## Next Steps

1. Fix client-side exceptions on producer pages
2. Fix Sanity schema issues
3. Fix blog hero image display
4. Create consistent grid components
5. Improve social preview & metadata

Each step will be implemented with no breaking changes, maintaining backward compatibility with existing data structures and functionality.
