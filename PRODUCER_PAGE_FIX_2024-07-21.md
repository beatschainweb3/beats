# Producer Page Fix - July 21, 2024

## Issue Analysis

The client-side exception on `/producer/default-1` and `/producer/sample-producer` is caused by:

1. Premature execution of `useReadContract` hooks before producer data is available
2. Unsafe data access without proper checks
3. Dynamic imports of wagmi actions causing potential timing issues

## Solution Approach

1. Refactor the producer page component to use safer data fetching patterns
2. Implement proper conditional rendering for Web3 hooks
3. Add comprehensive error handling
4. Create fallback UI for when Web3 data is unavailable

## Implementation Steps

1. Modify the `useReadContract` hooks to only execute when producer data is available
2. Add proper error boundaries around Web3 functionality
3. Implement defensive programming with optional chaining
4. Create a more robust loading state that doesn't depend on contract data

## Code Changes Required

1. Update `/packages/app/src/app/producer/[id]/page.tsx`:
   - Wrap Web3 hooks in conditional rendering
   - Add proper error handling
   - Implement safer data access patterns

2. Ensure the component gracefully handles:
   - Missing producer data
   - Failed contract calls
   - Disconnected wallet states
