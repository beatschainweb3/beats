### Web3 Stats Integration

The Web3 stats are displayed using the `StatsDisplay` component, which pulls data from Web3/Firebase, not Sanity. This ensures that all dynamic data remains in the Web3 system while allowing content editors to place and style the stats display through Sanity.

To add Web3 stats to a page:
1. Create a content block in Sanity
2. Select "Web3 Stats" as the block type
3. Configure layout and theme options
4. Add a title if desired

## Important Notes

1. **Platform Fee**: Always set to 15% to match the smart contract, regardless of what's set in Sanity

2. **Content vs. Data Separation**:
   - Sanity manages static content (pages, blog, SEO, images)
   - Web3/Firebase manages dynamic data (users, transactions, beats)

3. **Image Optimization**:
   - All images from Sanity are automatically optimized
   - Use the recommended sizes for best results

4. **SEO Best Practices**:
   - Keep meta titles under 60 characters
   - Keep meta descriptions under 160 characters
   - Always provide alt text for images
   - Use structured data for rich search results
