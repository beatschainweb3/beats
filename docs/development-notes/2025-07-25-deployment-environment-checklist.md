# Deployment Environment Checklist - July 25, 2025

## üö® Critical Environment Variables Missing

### Required for IPFS Upload Functionality
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_JWT=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
NEXT_PUBLIC_IPFS_GATEWAY=https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/
```

### Current Status
- ‚ùå **Production**: Environment variables not configured
- ‚úÖ **Development**: Working via .env.local
- ‚ùå **File Uploads**: Failing for files >4MB

## üîß Deployment Platform Configuration

### Vercel (if using)
```bash
# Add via Vercel Dashboard > Project > Settings > Environment Variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_JWT=your_jwt_token
NEXT_PUBLIC_IPFS_GATEWAY=https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/
```

### Netlify (if using)
```bash
# Add via Netlify Dashboard > Site Settings > Environment Variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_JWT=your_jwt_token
NEXT_PUBLIC_IPFS_GATEWAY=https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/
```

### Railway/Render (if using)
```bash
# Add via platform dashboard environment variables section
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_JWT=your_jwt_token
NEXT_PUBLIC_IPFS_GATEWAY=https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/
```

## üìã Verification Steps

### 1. Check Console Logs
After deployment, check browser console for:
```
üîç IPFS Config Check:
JWT: SET
Gateway: SET
IPFS Ready: YES
```

### 2. Test File Upload
- Upload 5.4MB file
- Should see "Uploading to IPFS" instead of "localStorage fallback"
- Should succeed without "File too large" error

### 3. Environment Status Indicator
- Red warning should disappear from top-right corner
- No "IPFS Not Configured" message

## üéØ Priority Actions

### Immediate (Today)
1. **Identify Deployment Platform** - Vercel/Netlify/Railway/etc
2. **Add Environment Variables** - Copy from .env.local
3. **Redeploy** - Trigger new deployment with env vars
4. **Verify** - Test 5.4MB file upload

### Validation
1. **Console Check**: Look for "IPFS Ready: YES"
2. **Upload Test**: 5.4MB file should upload successfully
3. **Error Messages**: Should see IPFS upload progress, not localStorage fallback

## üìä Expected Results

### Before Fix
```
Console: "IPFS not configured, using localStorage fallback"
Upload: "File too large for storage"
Status: ‚ùå 5.4MB files fail
```

### After Fix
```
Console: "IPFS Ready: YES"
Upload: "Uploading to IPFS... ‚úÖ Complete"
Status: ‚úÖ 5.4MB files succeed
```

**Action Required**: Configure environment variables in deployment platform and redeploy. This is a configuration issue, not a code issue.
