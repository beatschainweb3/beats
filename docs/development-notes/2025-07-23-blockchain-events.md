## Blockchain Event Listeners Implementation

Today we implemented real blockchain event listeners for the BeatNFTCreditSystem contract. This enhancement allows the application to respond to on-chain events in real-time, providing users with immediate feedback about their transactions.

### Key Components

1. **Contract Event Hook**
   - Created a `useContractEvents` hook to listen for blockchain events
   - Implemented listeners for CreditsPurchased, ProNFTUpgraded, and CreditsUsed events
   - Integrated with the notification system to display real-time alerts

2. **BlockchainEventListener Component**
   - Updated the component to use both simulated and real blockchain events
   - Ensured backward compatibility with the existing notification system
   - Added support for multiple event types

3. **Transaction History Component**
   - Created a new component to display transaction history
   - Implemented sorting and filtering of transactions
   - Added links to Etherscan for transaction verification

### Implementation Details

The `useContractEvents` hook uses wagmi's `useWatchContractEvent` to listen for events from the BeatNFTCreditSystem contract. When an event is detected, it creates a notification using the enhanced notification system we implemented earlier.

```typescript
useWatchContractEvent({
  address: contractAddress,
  abi: BeatNFTCreditSystemAbi,
  eventName: 'CreditsPurchased',
  onLogs: (logs) => {
    logs.forEach(log => {
      const { args, transactionHash } = log
      
      // Only notify for events related to the current user
      if (args.user.toLowerCase() === address?.toLowerCase()) {
        const credits = Number(args.credits)
        const price = formatEther(args.price)
        
        addNotification(
          `You purchased ${credits} BeatNFT credits for ${price} ETH`,
          {
            type: 'credit',
            amount: Number(price),
            currency: 'ETH',
            transactionHash,
            metadata: {
              credits,
              price
            }
          }
        )
      }
    })
  }
})
```

### Benefits

1. **Real-time Updates**
   - Users receive immediate notifications when their transactions are confirmed
   - The UI updates automatically without requiring page refreshes
   - Transaction history is always up-to-date

2. **Improved User Experience**
   - Clear feedback about transaction status
   - Detailed information about each transaction
   - Links to Etherscan for verification

3. **Reliability**
   - Fallback to simulated events when blockchain connectivity is limited
   - Local storage backup for offline access
   - Graceful handling of network issues

### Next Steps

1. **Event Filtering and Pagination**
   - Implement filtering options for transaction history
   - Add pagination for large transaction lists
   - Optimize performance for users with many transactions

2. **Enhanced Analytics**
   - Track event metrics for analytics
   - Provide insights about user activity
   - Identify patterns and trends

3. **Push Notifications**
   - Implement push notifications for mobile devices
   - Add email notifications for important events
   - Allow users to customize notification preferences

### Testing

To test the blockchain event listeners:

1. Connect your wallet to the Sepolia testnet
2. Purchase credits or upgrade to Pro BeatNFT
3. Wait for the transaction to be confirmed
4. Check for notifications and updated transaction history
