# BeatsChain Development Notes - July 23, 2025

## Sepolia Testnet Deployment

Today we prepared for the deployment of the BeatNFTCreditSystem contract to the Sepolia testnet. This is an important step in our development process as it allows us to test the contract in a more realistic environment before deploying to mainnet.

### Deployment Preparation

1. **Security Improvements**
   - Removed hardcoded private keys from the codebase
   - Added security checks to prevent deployment with default keys
   - Created comprehensive security documentation

2. **Deployment Scripts**
   - Created a dedicated script for Sepolia deployment
   - Added validation checks for wallet balance and security
   - Implemented contract verification automation

3. **Documentation**
   - Created a step-by-step guide for Sepolia deployment
   - Documented security best practices
   - Added troubleshooting information

### Deployment Process

The deployment to Sepolia will follow these steps:

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Create a secure wallet for Sepolia deployment
   - Obtain Sepolia ETH from a faucet
   - Configure environment variables with API keys

2. **Contract Deployment**
   - Deploy the BeatNFTCreditSystem contract
   - Verify the contract on Etherscan
   - Update frontend configuration with the new address

3. **Testing**
   - Test credit purchases
   - Test Pro NFT upgrades
   - Verify event emission and handling

### Contract Address

Once deployed, the contract address will be updated in the frontend configuration:

```typescript
const BeatNFTCreditSystemAddress = {
  1: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000', // Mainnet - not deployed
  11155111: 'NEW_SEPOLIA_ADDRESS', // Sepolia - deployed
  31337: '0x5fbdb2315678afecb367f032d93f642f64180aa3' // Local - deployed
} as const
```

### Security Considerations

We've implemented several security measures for this deployment:

1. **Dedicated Deployment Wallet**
   - Using a separate wallet specifically for Sepolia deployments
   - Keeping minimal funds in the deployment wallet

2. **Environment Variable Management**
   - Storing private keys in .env files (not committed to Git)
   - Using .env.example files for documentation

3. **Deployment Validation**
   - Checking wallet balance before deployment
   - Verifying contract functionality after deployment
   - Preventing deployment with known private keys

### Next Steps

After successful deployment to Sepolia, we will:

1. **Frontend Integration**
   - Update the frontend to use the deployed contract
   - Test the full user flow with the deployed contract
   - Monitor for any issues or unexpected behavior

2. **Event Listeners**
   - Implement event listeners for contract events
   - Update the notification system to use real events
   - Test event handling with the deployed contract

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Monitor gas usage and optimize if necessary
   - Track contract interactions for any issues
   - Prepare for potential mainnet deployment
