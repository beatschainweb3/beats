# User Dashboard Strategy Plan - July 24, 2025

## Overview

Currently, BeatsChain has specialized dashboards for producers, creators, and admins. However, we need to address the general music lover/user experience who doesn't fit into these categories but still engages with the platform.

## Current Dashboard Landscape

### ✅ Existing Dashboards
1. **Producer Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) - For beat creators and sellers
2. **Creator Dashboard** (`/creator-dashboard`) - For content creators licensing beats
3. **Admin Dashboard** (`/admin`) - For platform administrators

### 🔍 Gap Analysis
- **General Users/Music Lovers**: No dedicated dashboard
- **Casual Buyers**: Limited engagement tools
- **Community Members**: No social features
- **Collectors**: No NFT collection management

## User Segmentation

### 1. Music Lovers/Fans 🎧
- **Primary Actions**: Browse, listen, discover new beats
- **Secondary Actions**: Follow producers, create playlists, share favorites
- **Blockchain Interaction**: Minimal (viewing only)

### 2. Casual Beat Buyers 💰
- **Primary Actions**: Purchase beats for personal projects
- **Secondary Actions**: Track purchases, download files
- **Blockchain Interaction**: Basic (purchase transactions)

### 3. NFT Collectors 🖼️
- **Primary Actions**: Collect beat NFTs, track portfolio value
- **Secondary Actions**: Trade NFTs, showcase collection
- **Blockchain Interaction**: Advanced (NFT management)

### 4. Community Members 👥
- **Primary Actions**: Engage with community, comment, rate
- **Secondary Actions**: Follow trends, participate in events
- **Blockchain Interaction**: Social (reputation tokens)
