# BeatsChain Development Notes - July 23, 2025

## Notification System Implementation

Today we implemented a robust notification system for the BeatsChain platform. This system will allow users to receive real-time notifications for important events such as purchases, royalty payments, and other blockchain events.

### Key Components

1. **Enhanced Notification Context**
   - Created a more robust notification context with support for different notification types
   - Added persistence with localStorage
   - Implemented read/unread status tracking

2. **Notification Center UI**
   - Added a notification bell to the header
   - Implemented a dropdown with notification list
   - Added visual indicators for unread notifications

3. **Blockchain Event Listeners**
   - Created a hook to listen for blockchain events
   - Implemented simulated events for testing
   - Added support for purchase and royalty notifications

4. **Integration with Purchase Flow**
   - Updated the purchase modal to trigger notifications on successful purchases
   - Added metadata to notifications for better context

### Next Steps

- Implement real blockchain event listeners using wagmi
- Add notification preferences in user settings
- Implement push notifications for mobile devices
- Add email notifications for important events

### Technical Considerations

The notification system is designed to work even when the blockchain API is unavailable. It uses a fallback mechanism to ensure that users still receive notifications for important events.

For blockchain events, we're currently using simulated events, but in the future, we'll implement real event listeners using wagmi's `useContractEvent` hook.

### Testing

To test the notification system:
1. Connect your wallet
2. Make a purchase
3. Wait for simulated blockchain events (10-20 seconds)
4. Check the notification bell for new notifications

### Feedback from Team

The team is excited about the notification system and has provided the following feedback:
- The notification bell is a great addition to the UI
- The dropdown is clean and easy to understand
- The different notification types are visually distinct
- The persistence with localStorage is a nice touch

We'll continue to refine the system based on user feedback.
