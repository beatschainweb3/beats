# Sepolia Deployment Summary - July 23, 2025

## BeatNFTCreditSystem Contract Deployment

Today we successfully deployed the BeatNFTCreditSystem contract to the Sepolia testnet. This is a significant milestone in our development process as it allows us to test the contract in a more realistic environment before deploying to mainnet.

### Deployment Details

- **Contract Name**: BeatNFTCreditSystem
- **Contract Address**: `0x950d8627eeb5361fc7f723fc6e23e223d751b23a`
- **Owner Address**: `0xc84799a904eeb5c57abbbc40176e7db8be202c10`
- **Network**: Sepolia (Chain ID: 11155111)
- **Deployment Date**: July 23, 2025
- **Etherscan Link**: [https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x950d8627eeb5361fc7f723fc6e23e223d751b23a#code](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x950d8627eeb5361fc7f723fc6e23e223d751b23a#code)

### Contract Features

1. **Credit System**
   - Users can purchase credits in packages (10, 25, 50 credits)
   - Credits are used for uploading beats (1-3 credits per upload depending on file type)
   - New users receive 10 free credits

2. **Pro NFT**
   - Users can upgrade to Pro NFT for 0.1 ETH
   - Pro NFT holders have unlimited uploads
   - Pro NFT is implemented as an ERC721 token

3. **Admin Functions**
   - Owner can grant free credits to users
   - Owner can add new credit packages
   - Owner can toggle package availability
   - Owner can withdraw contract funds

### Verification

The contract has been successfully verified on Etherscan, making the source code publicly available for transparency and security auditing.

### Frontend Integration

The frontend has been updated to use the new contract address:

```typescript
const BeatNFTCreditSystemAddress = {
  1: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000', // Mainnet - not deployed
  11155111: '0x950d8627eeb5361fc7f723fc6e23e223d751b23a', // Sepolia - deployed
  31337: '0x5fbdb2315678afecb367f032d93f642f64180aa3' // Local - deployed
} as const
```

### Next Steps

1. **Testing**
   - Test credit purchases on Sepolia
   - Test Pro NFT upgrades on Sepolia
   - Verify event emission and handling

2. **Event Listeners**
   - Implement event listeners for contract events
   - Update the notification system to use real events
   - Test event handling with the deployed contract

3. **Security Monitoring**
   - Monitor contract interactions for any issues
   - Track gas usage and optimize if necessary
   - Prepare for potential mainnet deployment

### Security Considerations

- The deployment was done using a secure wallet
- The contract has been verified on Etherscan for transparency
- The frontend has been updated to use the new contract address
- The contract includes security features like reentrancy guards

*Note: This deployment is part of our ongoing effort to decentralize the BeatsChain platform and provide true ownership of beats through blockchain technology.*
