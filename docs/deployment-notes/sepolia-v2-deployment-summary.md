### Frontend Integration Required

Update contract address in frontend:

```typescript
const BeatNFTCreditSystemAddress = {
  1: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000', // Mainnet - not deployed
  11155111: '0xcf7f010edb33f5c8582e8f97e20ef76be8b83311', // Sepolia V2 - deployed
  31337: '0x5fbdb2315678afecb367f032d93f642f64180aa3' // Local - deployed
} as const
```

### Migration Strategy

1. **Gradual Rollout**: Test V2 features with subset of users
2. **Data Migration**: Migrate existing user balances if needed
3. **Fallback Support**: Maintain V1 compatibility during transition
4. **User Communication**: Notify users of enhanced features

### Testing Checklist

- [x] Contract deployment successful
- [x] Contract verification on Etherscan
- [x] Initial credit balance confirmed (10 credits)
- [ ] Frontend integration testing
