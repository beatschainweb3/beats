# BeatsChain Deployment Plan

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

1. ✅ Content migration completed successfully
2. ✅ Navigation structure seeded in Sanity
3. ✅ Dynamic page component implemented with fallback system

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Verify Sanity Content

- Log into Sanity Studio and verify all migrated content
- Check that pages have correct titles, content, and slugs
- Ensure navigation structure is properly configured

### 2. Test Dynamic Routing

- Test each migrated page to ensure it loads correctly
- Verify that the dynamic page component renders Sanity content
- Test fallback system by temporarily disabling Sanity access

### 3. Update Environment Variables

Ensure these environment variables are set in production:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION=2023-05-03
```

### 4. Deploy to Staging

```bash
# Deploy to staging environment first
cd packages/app
yarn build
yarn deploy:staging
```

### 5. Staging Tests

- Verify all pages load correctly in staging
- Test navigation and links
- Check mobile responsiveness
- Verify SEO metadata and social sharing

### 6. Deploy to Production

```bash
# Deploy to production after staging tests pass
cd packages/app
yarn build
yarn deploy
```

### 7. Post-Deployment Verification

- Verify all pages load correctly in production
- Check analytics to ensure no traffic drops
- Monitor error logs for any issues

## Rollback Plan

If issues are encountered:

1. Identify the specific issue
2. If Sanity-related, verify the fallback system is working
3. If necessary, roll back to previous version:

```bash
cd packages/app
git checkout [previous_stable_commit]
yarn build
yarn deploy
```

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. Continue migrating any remaining content to Sanity
2. Implement a proper Portable Text renderer for rich content
3. Add content editing capabilities to the admin dashboard
4. Set up webhooks to rebuild the site when content changes
