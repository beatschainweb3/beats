# Grid Components Implementation - July 21, 2025

## Issue Analysis

The application needs consistent grid components for beats, producers, and blog posts:

1. Currently only has an `EnhancedBlogGrid` component
2. No equivalent components for beats and producers
3. Inconsistent UI patterns across content types

## Solution Approach

1. Create source-agnostic grid components that can work with different data types
2. Implement adapters for different data sources
3. Ensure consistent filtering, pagination, and featured item handling

## Implementation Steps

1. Create a BeatGrid component based on the EnhancedBlogGrid pattern
2. Create a ProducerGrid component with similar functionality
3. Ensure all grids support filtering, pagination, and featured items

## Code Changes Required

1. Create `/packages/app/src/components/BeatGrid.tsx`:
   - Adapt from EnhancedBlogGrid pattern
   - Modify for beat-specific data structure
   - Include filtering, pagination, and featured items

2. Create `/packages/app/src/components/ProducerGrid.tsx`:
   - Similar functionality to other grids
   - Adapt for producer-specific data
   - Ensure consistent UI patterns

3. Refactor shared functionality:
   - Extract common grid patterns to shared utilities
   - Create consistent interfaces for different data types
   - Implement responsive layouts for all grid components
