# Blog Hero Image Fix - July 21, 2025

## Issue Analysis

The blog article at `/blog/what-is-a-beatnft` is missing its hero image despite being available in Sanity because:

1. The blog post page component doesn't use the `mainImage` field for the hero background
2. The hero section has a hardcoded gradient background instead of using the image
3. There's inconsistent image URL handling between different components

## Solution Approach

1. Update the blog post page component to use the post's mainImage as the hero background
2. Implement proper image URL construction with fallbacks
3. Ensure consistent image handling across all blog components

## Implementation Steps

1. Modify the hero section in the blog post page to check for and use post.mainImage
2. Add proper image URL construction using the urlFor utility
3. Implement a fallback for when the image is unavailable

## Code Changes Required

1. Update `/packages/app/src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`:
   - Modify the hero section to use post.mainImage as background when available
   - Add proper image URL construction with urlFor
   - Keep the gradient as a fallback

2. Ensure consistent image handling:
   - Use the same pattern for image URL construction across components
   - Add proper error handling for image loading
   - Implement responsive image sizing
