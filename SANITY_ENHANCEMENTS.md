# BeatsChain Sanity CMS Enhancements

## Social Sharing Preview Fix

We've implemented a robust solution for social sharing previews:

1. **Dynamic OG Image API**
   - Created a dynamic API route at `/api/og/[slug]` that generates custom Open Graph images
   - Images include the page title, description, and BeatsChain branding
   - Fallback to default content if Sanity data isn't available

2. **SEO Component Integration**
   - Updated the dynamic page component to use the OG image API
   - Ensures consistent social sharing previews across all platforms

## Enterprise Content Blocks

Added advanced content block types to Sanity:

1. **Tabs Block**
   - Multiple tab styles (default, pills, underline, boxed)
   - Support for icons and rich content within tabs
   - Responsive design for all screen sizes

2. **Accordion Block**
   - Expandable/collapsible sections
   - Option to allow multiple open sections
   - Rich content support within each section

3. **Feature Cards Block**
   - Multiple card styles (default, bordered, shadowed, minimal)
   - Support for icons, images, and links
   - Configurable number of columns

4. **Additional Enterprise Blocks**
   - Steps Block for process flows
   - Testimonials Block for social proof
   - Pricing Table Block for subscription/pricing information

## Content Block Renderer

Created a flexible content block rendering system:

1. **ContentBlockRenderer Component**
   - Handles all block types in a unified way
   - Renders blocks based on their `_type` property
   - Extensible for future block types

2. **Individual Block Components**
   - Each block type has its own React component
   - Components handle their own styling and behavior
   - Consistent design language across all blocks

## Schema Updates

Updated Sanity schemas to support the new content types:

1. **Page Schema**
   - Added support for all new block types
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing content

4. **Better Social Sharing**
