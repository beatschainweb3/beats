# BeatsChain Implementation Summary - July 21, 2024

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Client-Side Exception on Producer Pages
- **Problem**: The producer page was throwing client-side exceptions due to premature Web3 hook execution.
- **Solution**: Refactored the producer page component to use safer data fetching patterns:
  - Created a separate Web3ProducerData component that only renders when producer data is available
  - Added proper error boundaries around Web3 functionality
  - Implemented defensive programming with optional chaining
  - Created a more robust loading state that doesn't depend on contract data

### 2. Blog Hero Image Missing
- **Problem**: The blog article hero image was not being displayed despite being available in Sanity.
- **Solution**: Updated the blog post page component to properly use the mainImage field:
  - Added state to store the processed hero image URL
  - Modified the hero section to use the image as a background when available
  - Implemented proper fallback to gradient background when image is not available

### 3. Sanity Schema Issues
- **Problem**: Unknown field error for `heroSection{"_type":"blogHero",...}` in Sanity Studio.
- **Solution**: Created the missing blogHero schema type:
  - Defined a new blogHero schema with appropriate fields
  - Updated the schema index to include the new type
  - Ensured compatibility with existing content

### 4. Missing Grid Components
- **Problem**: Inconsistent grid components across content types.
- **Solution**: Created consistent grid components for beats and producers:
  - BeatGrid component with filtering, pagination, and featured items
  - ProducerGrid component with similar functionality
  - Consistent UI patterns across all grid components
