# Production Environment Fix

## CORS Issue Resolution

The blog posts aren't showing because Sanity CORS origins need to be configured for production.

### Required Action:
1. Go to: https://sanity.io/manage/personal/project/3tpr4tci/api
2. Add CORS origin: `https://beatschain.app` (with credentials enabled)
3. Add CORS origin: `https://www.beatschain.app` (with credentials enabled)

### Alternative: Use Sanity CLI
```bash
npx sanity cors add https://beatschain.app --credentials
npx sanity cors add https://www.beatschain.app --credentials
```

### Current Status:
- ✅ Sanity variables are correct
- ✅ Blog schema exists
- ❌ CORS origins missing for production domain
- ❌ Studio stuck in CORS loop

### Fix Applied:
- Updated Sanity client to use hardcoded values for reliability
- Improved blog query to handle missing data gracefully
